# Security Policy

## 📝 Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is a **proof-of-concept for educational purposes only**. It is not intended for use in any production or real-world financial system.

As such, it is expected to have numerous security limitations and vulnerabilities by design. These are intentional to keep the code simple and understandable for learners.

### What to report

You should **only** report an issue if you find a bug that **breaks the core educational logic** described in the README (e.g., a flaw in the PoW validation or signature verification that makes the provided examples behave incorrectly).

### What not to report

Please **do not** report issues related to:
- Lack of P2P networking
- Absence of a mempool
- Scalability or performance problems
- Theoretical cryptographic attacks that are beyond the scope of this simple demo

## ⏳ Our Process

Since this is a static educational project, we do not provide active security patches. Any valid reports regarding broken core logic will be reviewed and may be fixed in a future commit for the benefit of learners.

Thank you for your understanding!
