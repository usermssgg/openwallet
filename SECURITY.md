## 📝 Reporting a Vulnerability

As this is an Academic Research Project focused on malware analysis, we take security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability within our analysis tools or documentation that could lead to unintended code execution outside of a sandbox environment, please follow these steps:

- **Do not open a public Issue.** This is to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability before a patch is available.  
- **Submit a Detailed Report.** Send your findings to the maintainer via the secure communication channel listed in the project's profile (or use the GitHub "Report Vulnerability" feature if enabled).  
- **Include Reproduction Steps.** Provide a clear description of the issue, the potential impact, and a step-by-step guide to reproduce the behavior.

## ⏳ Our Process

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48–72 hours.  
- **Investigation**: Our team will investigate the issue in an isolated environment.  
- **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a public disclosure date with you.

## ⚠️ Safe Harbor Strategy

This project is strictly for **Defensive Research**. We encourage security researchers to audit our tools, provided that:

- You do not use these tools for any illegal activity.  
- Your research is conducted in a strictly isolated (air-gapped) laboratory environment.  
- You comply with [GitHub’s Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies) regarding the handling of sensitive code.

Thank you for helping keep the security research community safe!
